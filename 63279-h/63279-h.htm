<h1>ADDRESS.</h1>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: It is not inappropriate to this occasion that an
officer of the navy should address your honorable Society,
and although your committee might easily have chosen a more
worthy representative of that branch of the public service,
they could have found none more sincerely interested in your
cause or more deeply impressed with its importance.</p>

<p>From the first disastrous effort, in 1819, to colonize the negroes
from the United States at Sherbro, up to the present time,
the Navy has contributed with sword and pen to advance the
interests and protect the rights of the Americo-Africans. In
that year, 1819, the U. S. Ship “Cyane” convoyed to Africa
the “Elizabeth,” the first emigrant ship, the “Mayflower” of
these new pilgrims, and Lieutenant Townsend lost his life in
the duty incidental to landing them. The inexorable march
of time, however, has placed upon the roll of the distinguished
dead most of those whose words and deeds contributed
so much to the founding of the Republic of Liberia. First
among these, and almost the first in the hearts and memories of
his naval brethren, stands the name of Stockton. In 1821 Lieut.
Stockton took command of the “Alligator,” a vessel sent out
by the U. S. Government at the earnest solicitation of Justice
Bushrod Washington, President of the Society, and Francis S.
Key, one of its managers, for the express purpose of selecting
a site on the Western Coast of Africa, better adapted to
the purposes of colonization than Sherbro, a place notoriously
unhealthy and in many respects undesirable. The first order
issued by Lieut. Commanding Stockton to the crew of his little
craft, while yet in sight of the shores of America, was to
throw overboard the cat, (the lash was then a legal mode of
punishment on board of our vessels of war,) informing them
that he intended to exact their obedience by some other
means. He was wiser than, perhaps, he knew, for, bound on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
this mission of humanity, there would have been a strange inconsistency
in his conduct had he carried with him into Africa
that vile relic of barbarism. Yet this act indicates the character
of the man who in that day, and in the face of current
opinion, dared to vindicate by word and deed the right of man,
black or white, to exemption from a barbarous thraldom
whether upon land or sea. December 11th, 1821, Lieut. Stockton
placed his foot on African soil at Cape Mesurado, and, at
the risk of his life, wrested from savagery that spot whereon
now stands the light-house guiding the mariner to Monrovia,
the Capital of a new born Republic, and in its firm foundations,
and its light gleaming alternately on land and sea, fitly emblematic
of him who ever stood fixed in his strong convictions
of the right, and showed to all men the guiding star of his
brilliant intellect and spotless character.</p>

<p>Liberia, then only an isolated spot of land, now spreads herself
on the south to the extent of 500 miles from this point.
A narrow belt upon the sea-shore, slowly but surely widening
her influence, brightening up the dark cloud in the background,
as year by year she struggles and penetrates here and
there, now up a river and then into the forest, like the streak
of light in the eastern sky which tells of the coming day. An
author says that the name of Stockton will be associated in
history with the names of the founders of this now prosperous
State, for to his courage and prudence its original acquisition
may be ascribed. Accompanied only by one companion he
went into the presence of the native King of that part of
the Coast, and when threatened with instant death, presented
his pistol at the head of the angry chief, cowing the multitude
by the danger of their Sovereign and obtaining from the subdued
savages the desired territory.</p>

<p>If we add to this achievement in Africa the fact, that
throughout his brilliant career, he adhered with wonderful
pertinacity to his idea of punishment without the lash, until
he obtained, or greatly aided in obtaining, the passage of that
law which banished the cat from the Navy, we may fairly
place him high on its rolls as one whose memory we may
cherish, and whose deeds we may emulate, and point him out
to the Liberian as the man whose nature, revolting at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
inhumanity in any form, taught his own men before landing
on African soil that first lesson of freedom which Liberians
have since learned to appreciate as it deserves.</p>

<p>The name of Perry, among the brightest in the annals of
naval history, shone with undimmed lustre in the person of
Commodore M. C. Perry while in command of our squadron on
the Coast of Africa. Perry cruised along the Liberian seaboard,
using force when force was necessary, discretion, combined
with firmness, always. Under his surveillance the timid colonist
became more bold, and the wary savage more circumspect,
until when he left the station, Gov. Russwurm, of Cape Palmas,
was constrained to write him under date of December 25, 1843,
“Our prospects have been brighter since the arrival of your
squadron on this Coast than ever, and however willing we
were before to endure everything for liberty, our hearts swell
with gratitude to you for the deep interest expressed in our
future well-being. That a gracious Providence may long preserve
your life for usefulness, is the ardent prayer of every
citizen of Maryland in Liberia.”</p>

<p>From the time of Commodore Perry’s command (1844) up
to the commencement of our civil war the Navy was not without
its representatives on the Liberian Coast. Many prominent
officers not only gave that country their warmest support,
but have recorded their meed of praise to its inhabitants.
Commodore Joel Abbott, 1845, says: “Although it is the day
of small things with our colored colonists in Africa, yet I believe
there is no one who has visited them but is favorably impressed
with their present condition beyond what was anticipated,
and with the belief of their progressive improvement
and of their growing importance in all the relations concerning
Africa and the African race that should interest the
Christian philanthropist and statesman.”</p>

<p>Commodore Isaac Mayo, 1853, says: “I have long felt the
warmest interest in the only scheme which promised relief to
the colored people of our country, and this interest was confirmed
by my visit to Liberia, when in command of the frigate
“Macedonian,” in the years 1843 and 1844. My more recent
observations in this ship convince me that the Colonization
Societies have been crowned with the most substantial success,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and that the result of their generous philanthropy is no longer
doubtful.... I have the strongest faith
in the bright future that awaits Liberia, and the strongest
confidence that she is to wield the most powerful influence in
regenerating Africa.”</p>

<p>Commodore Francis H. Gregory, 1855, says: “Previously to
my visiting Liberia I had a hope the Colonization Society
would be successful. I considered it an experiment and entertained
but little faith, but on my first visit to Monrovia
every doubt was dispelled. I visited the people collectively
and individually and had every opportunity of forming a correct
judgment of their condition and prospects.... I
found the people industrious and happy, apparently in the
enjoyment of every domestic comfort, and some of the most
opulent having many of the luxuries and elegancies of more
famed and refined regions.” By those to whom Commodore
Gregory was known, the value of his testimony will be appreciated.
Throughout a long and earnest life this officer devoted
all of his time and thought to the service of his country.</p>

<p>Paymaster General Bridge, in his “Journal of an African
Cruiser,” remarks, “After having seen much, and reflected upon
the subject even to weariness, I write down my opinion that
Liberia is firmly planted and is destined to increase and
prosper. This it will do though all further support from the
United States be discontinued.... My
faith is firm in a favorable result.”</p>

<p>Chaplain Chas. W. Thomas adds his testimony in the following
extracts from “Adventures and Observations in Africa:”
“Our duty as a Christian nation towards her (Liberia) is clear.
Far be it from us to witness with cold-blooded indifference the
struggles of those who have gone out from us with barbarism
and ignorance. If Liberia is a weak and myopic child, it is
not ours to look calmly upon her attempts to walk alone, guessing
cruelly as to the chances of her making a safe journey, but
it is ours by kind words to encourage her heart and to lead her
by the hand until age shall bring strength to her feet and
clearness to her vision.”</p>

<p>Perhaps upon the Navy list we have no purer and nobler
character than that of the late Rear Admiral A. H. Foote. Foote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
wielded the sword and the pen of the philanthropist, the Christian,
and the patriot. How much the lessons he learned while on
the Coast of Africa in command of the brig “Perry,” among
the iniquities of the slave-trade and the struggles of the Liberian
colonists had to do with the excellence of his character,
may be traced in the history of his life. He says: “Civilization
with its peace, intelligence with its high aims, was rooted
in Africa. The living energy of republicanism was there,
Christianity in various influential forms was among the people.
Education was advancing and institutions for public good
coming into operation. Native hereditary enmities and factions
were yielding perceptibly in all directions to the gentle
efficacy of Christian example. All this constituted a great
result.”</p>

<p>The Christian virtues of Admiral Foote are the property of
the country, his professional qualities are the inheritance of
the Navy—these will be remembered as long as we have a
Country to defend or a Navy to defend it.</p>

<p>The concurrent testimony of these distinguished officers and
thoughtful men, embracing the period from the foundation of
the colony to the time of our civil war, express not only the
hope, but the belief that Liberia, poor and weak as she is, yet
possesses many of the elements of national wealth and
strength, and proves beyond cavil the progress and the permanence
of that Republic.</p>

<p>During the war, and while our own nationality was in peril,
the Navy had but little time to spare for the interests of Liberia.
The battle for the freedom of the black man was being
fought upon a grander scale than within her narrow limits.
After that victory had been gained our ships began once more
to visit the African Coast, though at rare intervals.</p>

<p>In 1873 it became my duty and my pleasure to visit the
Coast of Africa, after an interval of twenty-five years. A quarter
of a century had passed leaving its furrows upon my face,
as it does upon the face of every son of Adam, but the interest
I had felt in that lone lorn colony was as fresh as ever. It
was therefore with unmixed satisfaction that I landed again
at Cape Mesurado, and in an instant recalled the familiar streets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and many of the faces that used to greet me in Monrovia
years ago.</p>

<p>I do not propose to go into the history of Liberia; that is to
be found in every Cyclopedia—those who run may read it. My
own personal impressions will be of more interest to you; these
have vitality which comes of contact, a freshness not to be
found in the musty pages of a book however well written.
Personal experience compared with history is the original compared
with the photograph.</p>

<p>Cape Mesurado juts out into the sea, a promontory of gentle
height, covered with the verdure which the tropics only can
produce. The surf roars at its base and the water of the
Mesurado river breaks over the bar by its side—the canoe of
the native glides through the surf over this bar and lands you
with wonderful safety at Monrovia, which lies just behind
the cape by the side of the river.</p>

<p>In the growth of a new nation, in its consolidation and crystalization,
<i>time</i> forms no just measure of <i>progress</i>. Not to go
back, to stem the adverse tide, to wait, is absolutely to advance.
To be where you were, after years of struggles against obstacles
almost insurmountable, is a point gained, and a success
accomplished.</p>

<p>Monrovia presented the same sunny streets and shaded
houses, the same evidences of comfort, and of the absence of
want, that it did twenty-five years before; no great mark of
improvement, no sad evidences of decay. In the meanwhile,
however, more activity on the wharves, more canoes laden
with produce coming down the river, steamships stopping
eight times a month landing and receiving cargo, more sugar
mills, coffee trees growing where the forest undisturbed had
waved before—all this, and more, indicated life, business, commercial
and agricultural prosperity.</p>

<p>I thought to myself as I walked again through the streets,
“Monrovia is a <i>fixed fact</i>.” No reflux tide can wash her into
the sea. She may advance more rapidly, she may stand still.
But every event, whether rapid, slow, or stationary in her
course, Liberia is there to <i>stay</i>. An island in the ocean of
barbarism, “a little cloud out of the sea like a man’s hand,”
yet full of portent to Africa, a herald of the coming of that army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of civilization which by an inexorable law exterminates where
it cannot convert.</p>

<p>But a great change manifested itself in the temper and tone
of the people. Years ago I saw indicated everywhere that innate
consciousness of inferiority, that deprecating humility
which came of their birth—emigrants from the slave cabins in
our own country—that absence of independent thought, that
shrinking humility which feared to give an opinion; these
came from the remembrance of that grand old thing, now of
the past—the <i>master</i>. With warm affections toward their
home, as they called America, favors easily remembered and
wrongs as easily forgotten, they welcomed us and bore with
us as we tacitly claimed that superiority which comes of
being born white men.</p>

<p>Now a change had taken place, a new generation had come
and a regeneration. We were welcomed with hospitality devoid
of servility, and with kindness devoid of fear. They
acknowledged gratefully the protection which the American
flag affords them, not more for the fact than as a token of
remembrance from the mother country.</p>

<p>President Roberts is an epitome of Liberian history. He
stands pre-eminently the guiding genius of Liberia through
all her struggles. That there is none equal to him in point of
ability, combined with wisdom and linked to virtue; that he
is superior to all in these respects, to every other Liberian, is
no more an argument for the average inferiority of the colored
race than the proud pre-eminence of George Washington is an
argument for the inferiority of the American branch of the
white race. The history of nations is written in the lives of
individuals. President Roberts has shaped the destiny of his
country, and as much as any other man living has contributed
to the moral and physical good of the human race.</p>

<p>I dined at President Roberts’ table with the members of his
Cabinet, Ex-President Warner, and the Haytien Consul, Mr.
Yates. Most of them were new men to me. They exhibited
a general knowledge of passing events which, from their
isolated condition, would have surprised me, had I not in previous
experience observed that men forced to read what others
daily saw were generally more accurate in their knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and more critical in their deductions. The Cabinet of Mr.
Roberts seemed to me respectable men, quite up to the average
of men, whether white or black.</p>

<p>Without disparagement to others, I wish to make a brief
mention of a pleasant visit to the house of a private citizen.
This house was presided over by a lady whose refined and
elegant manners would have attracted attention and admiration
in any drawing-room. In her conversation she exhibited
a brilliancy which was really remarkable, and an intelligence
quite as surprising. She was Liberian born, but spoke of
America with the love she had inherited.</p>

<p>Along the streets and by-ways of Monrovia are to be seen
the ordinary variety of human beings, young and old, rich
and poor, sick and well. You note the absence of grogshops
and the presence of churches. Like pilgrims as they are, or
were, the prevailing and controlling sentiment of the community
is a religious one. To land upon a foreign shore, to cut
one’s self off from kith and kin, to plunge into a wilderness,
needs faith absolute, vital, in the personality of God and in
Divine protection. Add to this the emotional character of the
negro and you have the ordinary Liberian; law-abiding and,
from his nature and race, indolent, timid, willing to be helped,
loth to help himself. I do not mean to compare this colonist
with the great domineering, self-asserting, self-dependent
Anglo-Saxon, who bullies and conquers and rules wherever
he emigrates, but I do mean to say that Liberia and its inhabitants
will compare, and favorably, too, with the towns and the
people scattered over Central and South America and Mexico,
settled by the Spaniard, the Italian, and the Frenchman. Go
where you will in these countries you see the same evidences
of indolence, the same apparent lack of progress, yet these
people <i>are</i> prospering in their way, gradually but surely reaching
a higher plane, and so I contend are the Liberians. Remember,
the Liberians were <i>poor</i> even to abject poverty, they
had received no inheritance but the badge of their servitude,
they were ignorant—the law in this free country of ours had
taken care to keep them so—painfully ignorant, not only of
the common principles of law by which they were to construct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
a government, but of the common principles of life by which
they were to live.</p>

<p>God measures people for Himself. He is patient because He
is Eternal. Fifty years in the life of a nation born under such
adverse circumstances, struggling under poverty and obliquy—predicted
a failure by the prophets of caste, checked and
thwarted by the priests and politicians of conservatism, unaided,
uncheered, born in a wilderness, surrounded, hemmed
in by barbarism while just emerging from barbarism itself—fifty
years in the life of such a nation is but a moment of time
in the Providence of God. Let us then endeavor in our imperfect
way to imitate God’s patience and wait while we hope
and pray.</p>

<p>The Krooman, whose tribes are scattered for eighty miles
along the Liberian Coast, is the Bedouin of the African sea.
He is the sailor-man and the boat-man for every ship that
comes and sails down the Coast. His skill in landing through
the surf and passing over bars in his frail canoe is something
wonderful. His canoe and himself are one and the same thing;
together they glide over the swell of the ocean <i>with speed and
safety, now hidden, now seen</i>. If capsized he soon rights his
boat, rolls in again and paddles away. He is a bird upon the
water and a fish in the sea. Always willing and obedient, he
is honest and trustworthy. He wants his wages when his
contract is up, when he returns to his tribe and invests in
another wife. Wives are his treasures; they are the support
of his old age. He speaks a little English, of which he is very
proud. Some ship-master gives him a fantastic name, as
“Draw Bucket” or “Plug of Tobacco,” to which he clings as
his badge of honor, and his merits are duly recorded in his
“book,” which he receives from his employer and carries around
his neck, each succeeding master increasing the wealth of his
recommendation. His mother is his great object of reverence;
he never ventures to dispute her authority. In this respect
he never “comes of age.”</p>

<p>If Monrovia, the capital, had not largely increased in wealth
and population during these twenty-five years, Liberia had extended
her boundaries league by league, each additional possession
encroaching upon or destroying some well-known haunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of the slave trader, until for six hundred miles of the adjacent
Coast not a slave factory could be found or a slaver get a cargo.
In the very nature of things slavery was abhorrent to Liberia.
It could not exist within or near her borders. It disappeared
by virtue of the expelling force which exists in the power of
light and civilization. These two things could not be at the
same time in the same place. By this moral alliance with the
Powers of the world—this silent partnership, which in the end
banished the trade in human beings from the entire Coast of
Western Africa; this passive victory over the greatest sin of
modern times—by this deed alone she has earned her title to
the possession of her territory, and her friends and the friends
of humanity have met with more than their reward.</p>

<p>An author says, in 1853: “The fact stands acknowledged
before the world that Great Britain, after the expenditure of
more than one hundred millions of dollars, has failed in suppressing
the slave trade on one mile of Coast beyond the limit
of her colonies, while Liberia has swept it from nearly four
hundred miles of Coast where it existed in its chief strength,
liberated 80,000 slaves, and bound by treaties 200,000 natives
never to engage in the traffic in their brethren.”</p>

<p>Liberia, geographically considered, is situated upon the West
Coast of Africa, between the latitudes 4° 20´ and 7° 20´ north. It
extends from the British Colony of Sierra Leone, on the northwest,
to the Pedro river, on the southeast, a distance of 600
miles along the Coast, the interior boundary varying from 10
to 40 miles from the seaboard, an area of 9,700 square miles,
every mile of which has been <i>purchased</i> from the original proprietors.
No war of conquest marks this gradual enlargement
of territory or mars the record of the consequent progress. In
1873, the period of my last visit, Monrovia, the capital, had about
13,000 inhabitants. The total number of Americo-Liberians
in the Republic at that time was estimated at 20,000, and 700,000
aborigines. The Americans are settled in sixteen towns,
all of which have the characteristics of Monrovia, and are
situated in propinquity to the sea. Millsburg, which is twenty
miles up the St. Paul’s river, is an agricultural settlement.</p>

<p>The most important of the native tribes is the Mandingo,
which occupies nearly the whole of the eastern frontier of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Liberia. These people are Mahomedans, and their influence
extends into the interior of the Continent as far as Soudan.
Travelers in Africa agree upon the fact that Mahomedanism
is spreading over that land with marvelous strides. I ask
your attention to this religious phenomenon in connection
with the prospects of Liberia as a Christian community. If
you believe that Christianity is to be the religion of the future
in Africa, essential not only to her salvation but to her temporal
welfare, then I beg you to consider Liberia as an important
bulwark against the encroachment of the followers of
the Prophet, and as a point from whence to start Christian
propagandism into the heart of Africa. Most of the foreign
settlements on the Coast are simply trading ports, and the duty
of Christianizing the country is lost sight of in the pursuit of
gain. Liberia, on the other hand, is a Christian community,
established as such. Upon it and upon its friends devolves
this positive mission, preaching the Gospel to the heathen. It
is our duty to assist her in this mission by every means in our
power. Liberia is the initial point for American effort in the
Christianization of Africa. The tendency of all the African
tribes is to approach the sea; most of the tribal wars are made
on this account. To reach the “heach,” as they call it, to open
trade with the white man is the great object of their ambition.
To occupy the “heach,” therefore, to present there the bold
front of Christianity, is to set back the tide of Mahomedanism
and to bring within the peaceful influence of Christianity the
pagan when, after his struggles, he reaches the sea.</p>

<p>Among the other tribes living in the Liberian territory is
the Grebo. This tribe occupies the land in the immediate
vicinity of Cape Palmas and is the one now threatening that
portion of the Republic with a war of extermination.</p>

<p>I mean no disrespect to the people of Great Britain when I
say that the British trader on the Coast of Africa is among the
most grasping and unscrupulous of men. He has succeeded
the Frenchman, the Spaniard, and the Portuguese, those reckless
factors in the prosecution of the slave trade, and substituted
a trade in rum, tobacco, and gunpowder, a trade not
quite so baneful in its immediate results, but as pernicious as
it dares to be in the logic of events. These articles the native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
is eager to buy and the trader anxious to sell. Year by year
the British government, yielding to the demand of the British
trader, has increased its possessions upon the Coast either by
acquisition from the native Kings, or by purchase from foreign
Powers, until it owns 1,500 miles of the African shore. Liberia
is now bounded on its northern and southern limits by British
territory, but the trader, not content with this stealing as it
were in the rear of Liberian settlements with his contraband
products, is enticing the willing native to trade in violation of
the laws of the Republic, and inducing him to believe that if
the poor and defenseless Liberian settler can be driven from
his home, the trader can sell his goods without restriction and
at half the price; hence this war which is now trying the
courage and the resources of the Liberians.</p>

<p>These two tribes, the Mandingos and Grebos, both of them
intelligent and aggressive, the one crusaders in the name of
Mahomet, and the other warriors in the cause of greed and
gain, form the most important elements in the internal economy
of the Republic. The destiny of Liberia depends on the
conquest of these two opposing forces. Will she? Will she?
She must meet and conquer morally and physically these antagonistic
ideas or see herself swept into the sea; but I have
faith that she will conquer in the name of God and with the
aid of America. We know that God will not fail them; let us
see to it that America does not fold her arms and turn upon
these struggling people the cold shoulder of indifference.</p>

<p>The other tribes that come under the jurisdiction of the
Government of Liberia are the Veys, the Pessehs, the Barlines,
and the Bassas. The Veys are amongst the most intelligent,
and thirty years ago made an alphabet for themselves. Mahomedanism
is rapidly spreading among them. None of these
have any special significance. They constitute, however, the
material nearest at hand for the missionary and the philanthropist.</p>

<p>According to my observation among the heathen, conversion
to Christianity is not the work of a moment, it is an influence
gradually permeating and pervading, until a community finds
itself raised to a higher plane, converted to a nobler faith.
This I anticipate will, in a measurable period of time, be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
result of the moral influence of the Americo-African upon the
surrounding mass of barbarism. One by one its dark superstitions
will disappear in the everincreasing light, until in the
brightness of mid-day the Sun of Righteousness will cast His
beneficent rays on the whole area of that broad and benighted
land.</p>

<p>I found the climate of Liberia decidedly improved since my
first visit. As the land is cleared miasmatic influences become
less fatal. To the native-born Liberian it is as healthful as
any tropical country. The emigrant takes his risks as any of
us do who migrate from a temperate to a torrid zone. The
white man has no business in Africa. “<i>Similia similibus curantur.</i>”
“Like things are cured by like.” To the black man,
the Ethiopian, is given the mission of laboring in the vineyard
until he comes to his own again. Time enters largely into this
problem of regenerating Africa. But it will be done and find
its reward in Eternity. Without conflicting with the theories
of the savans, I take it upon myself to say that to the white
and black races is given the glorious work of rehabilitating
the world, each in its own latitude and in its own way.</p>

<p>The Government of Liberia is apparently stable and well
administered. It would be an anomaly in political history to
find the off-shoot of a republican country establishing for itself
any other than a republican form of government; her constitution
therefore is similar to our own, containing one proviso,
however, to which I wish to draw your attention.</p>

<p>Liberia came into existence as a nation preceded by no war;
she was born of no internecine strife, but in harmony with
her mission she declared herself free and independent, and
was gracefully acknowledged as such by the Great Powers of
the world—the mother country alone hesitating to receive as
an equal her neglected child—and in an humble and lowly
manner, becoming her color and condition, she peacefully and
quietly took her back seat in the family of nations. I say
that Liberia has a government apparently stable. Compare
it, in the twenty-eight years of its existence, with the government
of France in its throes with monarchism, pseudo republicanism,
imperialism, and communism—“everything by turns
and nothing long”—or with that of Spain in its dynastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
revolutions. It seems to me that the people of Liberia are in
the hands of a guiding Power, which carries them hither and
thither, always safely, to the end that they may become the
arbiters of the fate of their race, the peaceful conquerors of a new
world. I know it is the fashion to deride such pietistic notions,
to sneer at such unscientific theories; but, my friends, as I grow
older, as I watch the ebbing and flowing of the human tides,
as I read of human destiny moulded to serve Divine ends, I feel
how insignificant men are in themselves, how great they are
in the hands of God. I say that the government has, in the
main, been well administered. The <i>world</i>, so called, <i>i. e.</i>, the
greed, the superstition, the bigotry, the clannish conservatism,
added to the thoughtlessness and the indifference of the world,
combine to crush out these abstract notions, these impracticable
ideas of the mere philanthropist, to deny the capacity
of certain “inferior” races for self-government, to prognosticate
failures, to come in with malevolent predictions, to settle
the whole matter finally with complacent “I told you so.”</p>

<p>There is no denying that Liberia has had her crisis, that she
has trembled on the verge of ruin, that her rulers have made
mistakes; but I contend that she has recovered from these
shocks with increased stability and without the barbarism of
bloodshed. Run your eye over the pages of contemporaneous
history, read of the bloody executions, the fusillades in France,
count the victims to the garoté in Cuba, number the exiles to
Siberia, count the expatriated in New Caledonia—all in the
name of order and good government—then turn to the records
of our own eventful career or to the modest pages of Liberian
history, and tell me which of all the Powers contain within
themselves the surest foundations, the best promise of stability
and permanence. Like our own, the Government of Liberia
is based upon the will of the people, and although sometimes
swayed from the path of wisdom by popular clamor, it in the
main has been administered for the <i>good</i> of the people. Resting
as it is upon education, secular and religious, it possesses a
constantly increasing tendency toward perfect excellence and
consequent permanence.</p>

<p>I dislike to be considered as a constant apologist, but the
Republic of Liberia is on trial, and she needs the services of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
even so poor a pleader as myself. If we, gentlemen, have <i>real</i>
faith in our own institutions, we <i>must</i> also have faith in the
institutions of our little sister Republic. And in order to form
an unbiased opinion we must lose sight of the question of <i>color</i>.
Fortunately for the future of Liberia, the homogeneousness of
her population removes one of her greatest dangers. In our
own country the question of <i>caste</i> is yet to be fought out, and
in my opinion upon its result will depend the permanence of
our own Government and the stability of our own institutions.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“For in this Union, you have set</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Each loathing each.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Events are rapidly shaping themselves, and at this present
moment we hardly know how swiftly we are approaching the
crisis which is to determine the question of color—of equal
rights to all men, without regard to color, in the administration
of the Government of this country. While, therefore, we
remember Liberia, let us not forget ourselves, or the day may
come when she can point out to us the fatal rock upon which
we split.</p>

<p>I do not apprehend for Liberia dangers from incapacity of
her rulers or instability in her institutions. She has had her
Roberts, her Benson, her Benedict, and hosts of others, good
and true, and she will find their peers in the time of her need.
She has her schools and her churches, and under their tuition
her next generation will improve upon this as this has upon
the last. She will resist the heathen and drive back the Mahomedan.
The danger which I <i>do</i> apprehend for her is the
danger of <i>absorption</i>.</p>

<p>They themselves seem to have had a half-prophetic dread of
this absorption. In her earliest days Elijah Johnson, amidst
the dangers of a threatened attack by the surrounding savage
tribes, being offered a force of marines from a British man-of-war
if he would only cede a few feet of land on which to plant
a British flag, promptly refused, saying, “We want no flagstaff
put up here that would cost more to get down again than
it would to whip the natives.” <i>Now this danger is at their very
doors.</i></p>

<p>A few years ago there was a rage for “internal improvements”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
in Liberia; $500,000 were borrowed in London, which
netted $425,000. This sum was again reduced by paying the
first two years’ interest in advance, and then from the remainder
was deducted the agents’ commissions, until finally it
reached Monrovia in gold and useless goods to the aggregate
amount of $200,000, and this residue has disappeared without
an “internal improvement.” To use a slang phrase, “We know
how it is ourselves.” From Canada to California every town
and village in the country has gone through the same experience,
but poor Liberia, with an income at the most of $100,000
a year, is unable to pay either principal or interest. She
lies at the mercy of her bondholders. England, with her lion’s
paw upon the trade of the world, would, and perhaps <i>will</i>
eventually, assume the debt for the trifling consideration of
possession. It is in fact a mortgage upon the integrity of
Liberia. Already England occupies 1,500 miles of the Coast;
already she hems in Liberia, the most coveted of all, on the
north; already the British trader is encroaching upon her
boundaries and stealing in behind her settlements. Slowly
and surely the process of absorption will go on to its consummation
as the anaconda swallows the kid. England herself is
almost powerless to stay it unless we intervene.</p>

<p>I don’t mean by intervention that cold-blooded indifferentism
which measures every national emotion with the line and
plummet of international law, which restrains within the
bounds of obsolete diplomacy every beat of the nation’s heart.
I mean the warm, sympathetic intervention which will say to
all the world, that, happen what may, the <i>United States of
America will see to it that no power on earth shall obliterate from
the map of Africa the infant Republic of Liberia</i>.</p>

<p>In this centennial year, the proudest anniversary in recorded
history, which proclaims in trumpet tones the triumphant fact
that a government by the people and for the people is not
only the best but the stablest on earth, let us extend to our
own offspring the right hand of fellowship, and declare by
every legitimate means we will help her forward in that career
which has led us to our present proud pre-eminence. In the
language of another who visited Liberia at the same time I
did, and came away as deeply impressed, “We are bound to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
help them by all the considerations that have force with men
and nations. By interest and by sympathy we are bound.
By interest, because Liberia, the only American colony on the
West Coast of Africa, once strong and resting under the protection
of the American flag, would open to us the inexhaustible
riches of Africa, and in so doing would revive the lost
glories of American commerce, which, to our national shame
and disgrace, has almost faded from the seas. By sympathy,
because of the close parallel between their history and our
own. Like us, they went forth from a land where they could
no longer remain with honor; to battle for the dear sake of
freedom, with poverty, with privation, with hostile savages,
and with all the thousand difficulties of an unknown and barbarous
land. Like us, they struggled, if not with oppression,
still under neglect, and, like us, they conquered. Like
us, they have declared and maintained themselves a free
Republic, and if in less than thirty years of their national
existence they have not accomplished all that they desired,
the failure has been largely owing to our own indifference
to the children whom we sent out from among us, and then
left to take care of themselves. Their love for us is strong.
Like most strong affections, ill-treatment only seems to augment
its force. Their confidence in us, though so abused, is
still unabated. Can we, in this their hour of need and danger,
coldly pass by on the other side? Surely it has been
want of knowledge, not want of interest, that has so long held
us supine. Let us make the parallel, so strong in the past,
hold good for the future. Let us strengthen the hands of Liberia,
that she may be enabled to do for Africa what we have
already done for America.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, we <i>can</i> intervene in the cause of Liberia, if requested
so to do by her government. Article 8, of the treaty
between the United States of America and Liberia, concluded
at London, October 21, 1862, says:</p>

<p>“The United States Government engages never to interfere,
unless solicited by the Government of Liberia, in the affairs
between the aboriginal inhabitants and the Republic of Liberia
in the jurisdiction and territories of the Republic. Should
any United States citizens suffer loss, in person or property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
from violence by the aboriginal inhabitants, and the Government
of the Republic of Liberia should not be able to bring
the aggressor to justice, the United States Government engages,
a requisition having been first made therefor by the
Liberian Government, to lend such aid as may be required.
Citizens of the United States residing in the territories of the
Republic of Liberia are desired to abstain from all such intercourse
with the aboriginal inhabitants as will tend to the violation
of law and a disturbance of the peace of the country.”</p>

<p>I violate no official propriety when I inform you that in all
probability a ship of war is now on her way to Liberia for the
purpose of protecting American interests, and of aiding the
authorities, if so requested, in the suppression of insurrection
among the natives. That this intervention will be effectual
not only in suppressing the natives, but indirectly in suppressing
the zeal of the white traders, I have not the slightest doubt.
This assistance to Liberia is of a temporary nature; what she
needs and what <i>we</i> need is a permanent naval force on her
Coast, and she has almost a right to demand it; for Liberia is
our only colony, the only off-shoot of the parent stem, the only
American outpost on the confines of barbarism; it is our duty
to protect her for the sake of our institutions and for the sake
of our religion.</p>

<p>I therefore propose that the Government be requested to
establish a line of mail steamers, to consist of the smallest
class of naval vessels, half-manned and half-armed, to run
monthly between any designated port in the United States and
Liberia, touching on that Coast at Monrovia and Cape Palmas,
and coaling each way at Porto Grande, Cape de Verde Islands.
These vessels to retain the character of men-of-war, and to
carry no passengers except officials of either government.</p>

<p>The distance from Norfolk to Monrovia is about 4,000 miles;
the quantity of coal required for each round voyage would be
about 320 tons, aggregating for a monthly service about 4,000
tons per annum. These ships could perform this duty at a
cost for coal of about $50,000.</p>

<p>A law of Congress appropriating this amount and authorizing
the President to employ the vessels on this duty would
be a great point gained for Liberia, by insuring a regular mail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
communication, and by having constantly on the Coast one or
other of these ships of war.</p>

<p>It is no new thing for men-of-war to be employed in this
service. England commenced her foreign postal system in
this way, which, subsequently taken up by private companies,
now ramifies over the globe and touches every port. The
same result would follow in this case. The merchantman
would follow the man-of-war, and thus the initial step would
be taken in securing the trade of Liberia to our own country.
I see no other way at present of inaugurating a direct trade
with Liberia; for our commercial pride has fallen so low, and
our capital has become so timid, that it dares not and cares
not to venture upon the sea. It is in vain that we appeal to
patriotism; it is in vain that we utter the truism that no nation
can be truly great without an external commerce. Our
merchants cross the sea, and point with complacency to the
foreign flag waving over their heads, and bring back their
goods in foreign bottoms, without any sense of the shame that
ensues.</p>

<p>It would also be utilizing the navy, which, in time of peace,
could find no nobler employment. It would, indeed, be but a
continuation of the aid which the Navy has heretofore given
to Liberia, and a new title to its claim of guardianship.</p>

<p>I submit this proposition to you, gentlemen, for your consideration,
and, if it meets with your approval, I suggest that
you endeavor to put it into practicable shape during the present
session of Congress.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States can give to Liberia
no material aid. We cannot pay her debts nor fight her battles.
We <i>can</i> throw over her the mantle of our protection.
We can say that we will not see her absorbed by any European
Power, nor obliterated by any savage horde; but, after all,
Liberia must work out her own salvation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who would be free—themselves must strike the blow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So I would say to Liberians: The history of your country is
full of instances of heroism in conflict with savages; of suffering
from scarcity of food; of endurance of the effects of climate—full,
I say, of instances of heroism and self-denial on the part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of your predecessors. Learn from their history to practice
their virtues now.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago Commodore Perry cautioned the colonists
against a growing timidity, a tendency to rely upon others
for the defense of their lives and property. He advised them
to build blockhouses as <i>our</i> forefathers did in the olden time;
to become accustomed to the use of arms, to organize at every
settlement, and learn not only to repel attack but to assume
the offensive, thereby instilling into the surrounding savages
that wholesome fear which is the greatest safeguard.</p>

<p>Be brave also in the face of nature as well as in the face of
the native; attack your forests, clear away the wilderness before
you. Agriculture is the handmaid of commerce. You cannot
have one without the other. The tiller of the soil is the nobleman
of the land. From the bosom of mother earth comes the
chief real wealth of the nation.</p>

<p>Bear the burden of your national debt cheerfully. For this
purpose submit to taxation; remember that repudiation of the
debt would be followed by extinction, and that your failure as
a nation would throw you back into the confused heap of mistakes
which the world would willingly attribute to the imbecility
of your race. You <i>must</i> carry this load upon your
shoulders. Consider what a load of debt this parent country
of yours is carrying for the sake of your race, for the vindication
of your title as Liberians—free men!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
